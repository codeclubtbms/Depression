                    <h3>TYPES OF DEPRESSION</h3>
                    <p>Depressive disorders come in many different types, and while there are many similarities to each type of depression, each has its own unique set of symptoms.</p>
                    <p>The most commonly diagnosed form of depression is Major Depressive Disorder, a condition whose primary symptom is an overwhelming depressed mood for more than two weeks. The depressed mood affects all facets of the person's life, including work, home life, relationships and friendships. A person with this kind of depression often finds it difficult to do much of anything or get motivated, so even going to seek treatment for this condition can be challenging.</p>
                    <p>Another type of depression is called dysthymia. Dysthymia is similar to Major Depressive Disorder, but the symptoms occur over a much longer period of time more than 2 years. This is considered a chronic form of depression, and treatment can be challenging as an individual with Dysthymia has often already tried all manner of treatment. Individuals diagnosed with this condition can also suffer from occasional bouts of Major Depressive Disorder.</p>
                    <p>A third type of depression is referred to as Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. This condition is diagnosed when a person is adjusting to some new facet or change in their lives that has caused a great deal of stress. This disorder can even be diagnosed when a person is experiencing a good event in their life:such as a new marriage or a baby being born. Because the individual usually just needs a little additional support in their lives during this stressful time, treatment is time-limited and simple.</p>
                    <p>Depression is also a symptom of other disorders, such as Bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is sometimes considered a mood disorder, but is not a form of depression. Bipolar disorder is characterized by swings of a person's mood from depression to mania (mania is when a person is feeling lots of energy, like they are on top of the world and can do almost anything, often trying to do just that). The cycling mood changes from severe highs (mania) and lows (depression) can sometimes be dramatic and rapid in some people, but most often they are gradual.</p>
